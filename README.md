# JOSM-Orphan-ways-map-paint-style


A map paint style that highlights orphan ways (those that have no tags and are not part of a relation).

Adding the map paint style to JOSM:

First, make the "Map paint style" window visible:

Add a new map paint style by clicking on the marked button:

Then click on the marked button as seen below:

Add a name and a path to where you saved the "notagsway.css" file:

The map paint style should then appear in the list. Check it and uncheck any other map paint style you can see there.

TaDAAAAM! You did it. Now be careful not to delete anything that is correctly mapped. Think about adding appropriate tags to the orphan ways you find!

This is how this map style will make your orphan ways look:
